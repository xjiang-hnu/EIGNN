# Enhancing Glassy Dynamics Prediction by Incorporating Displacement from Initial to Equilibrium States

This repository is the official implementation of EIGNN model.

## Raw Dataset

EIGNN model is trained and test with the [GlassBench](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10118191) dataset collectived by G. Jung [Roadmap on machine learning glassy liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14752). This dataset provides the initial positions, inherent posiitons and the cage positions associted to each configuration. The initial positions originate form
Shiba's [dataset](https://ipomoea-www.cc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/i29002/botan/public_dataset.tar.gz) from the paper [BOTAN: BOnd TArgeting Network for prediction of slow glassy dynamics by machine learning relative motion](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/158/8/084503/2868947/BOTAN-BOnd-TArgeting-Network-for-prediction-of).
