# Enhancing Glassy Dynamics Prediction by Incorporating Displacement from Initial to Equilibrium States

This repository contains the official implementation of the EIGNN model.


## Raw Dataset

The EIGNN model is trained and tested using the [GlassBench](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10118191) dataset, created by G. Jung and presented in the [Roadmap on Machine Learning for Glassy Liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14752). This dataset includes initial positions, inherent positions, and cage positions associated with each configuration. The initial positions are sourced from Shiba's [dataset](https://ipomoea-www.cc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/i29002/botan/public_dataset.tar.gz), which was introduced in the paper [BOTAN: BOnd TArgeting Network for Prediction of Slow Glassy Dynamics by Machine Learning Relative Motion](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/158/8/084503/2868947/BOTAN-BOnd-TArgeting-Network-for-prediction-of).

## Reproduce the Results

To facilitate the reproduction of the results of the EIGNN-cage model, we provide a [Google Colab notebook](https://github.com/xjiang-hnu/EIGNN/blob/main/Training%20and%20Test%20with%20EIGNN_Cage.ipynb). This notebook documents the entire process in detail, including data preprocessing, model initialization, and the training and testing procedures at a temperature of T=0.44. Hereâ€™s a summary of the Colab:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook describes the steps for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the raw data for model training.
2. **Model Initialization**: It includes a detailed description of the model architecture, along with the hyperparameters and configurations used.
3. **Training and Testing**: The notebook outlines the procedures for training the model at T=0.44, including the training loop, loss function, and evaluation metrics.
### Traing and Test Reuslts
In this Colab notebook, the trainging and testing results are recorded in the output cells. You can check that the finnl test reuslts of the EIGNN-cage model are as follows:
